CoolStation ‚Äì A CS Resource Hub üë©‚Äçüíª
CoolStation is a modern, full-stack web application designed as a microblog platform for Computer Science enthusiasts. It enables users to share, explore, and engage with bite-sized "Did You Know?" facts in an intuitive and responsive interface. Whether you are a student, developer, or industry professional, CoolStation offers an engaging environment to contribute and learn from community-curated knowledge.

This project showcases robust full-stack development practices, including user authentication, CRUD operations, real-time search, and responsive UI design. The backend is supported by a MongoDB database, ensuring scalable and efficient data handling.

Features
User Authentication: Secure registration and login using hashed passwords, ensuring safe user credential management.

Unique User Profiles: Validation logic prevents duplicate usernames by trimming whitespace and enforcing uniqueness.

Post Creation: Authenticated users can publish informative Computer Science facts, contributing to the community knowledge base.

Favorite System: Users can "like" posts, which are stored in their personal collection of favorites using efficient database operations.

Live Search Functionality: Posts can be filtered in real-time based on keywords found in the title or content.

Theme Toggle: Supports both dark and light mode for optimal viewing comfort across different environments.

Timestamps: Each post is timestamped, giving context to contributions and enabling chronological navigation.

Technology Stack
